Introduction\nGraph Theory is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects.\nDefinitions:\n\nVertex (Point/Join): Represents an object or node. Denoted by V.\nEdge (Line/Branch): Represents a connection between two vertices. Denoted by E.\nGraph (G): A graph is defined as an ordered pair G=(V,E), where V is a set of vertices and E is a set of edges.\n\nEach edge is associated with an unordered pair of vertices {u,v}.\n\n\n\n\n2. Degree of a Vertex\nThe degree (or valency) of a vertex v, denoted as d(v), is the number of edge ends connecting to it.\n\nUnofficial definition: Number of “welding points” at a vertex.\n\nExample:\nConsider a graph with vertices V={v1​,v2​,v3​} and edges E={e1​,e2​} where v2​ is connected to v1​ and v3​.\n\nd(v1​)=1\nd(v2​)=2\nd(v3​)=1\n\nSum of degrees: 1+2+1=4.\nNumber of edges (∣E∣) = 2.\nNotice that 4=2×2.\nHandshaking Lemma (First Theorem of Graph Theory)\nThe sum of degrees of all vertices in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges.\n∑i=1n​d(vi​)=2∣E∣\nConsequence: The sum of degrees is always even.\nTheorem 2: Odd Degree Vertices\nSince ∑d(vi​) is always even:\n∑dodd​+∑deven​=Even\nSince the sum of even degrees is obviously even, the sum of odd degrees must also be even. This is only possible if the number of odd-degree vertices is even.\n\n3. Simple Graph\nA Simple Graph is a graph that has:\n\nNo self-loops (an edge connecting a vertex to itself).\nNo parallel/multiple edges (multiple edges between the same pair of vertices).\n\nProperties of Simple Graphs\n1. Maximum Degree:\nIn a simple graph with n vertices, a vertex can be connected to at most all other n−1 vertices.\nΔ(G)≤n−1\n2. Maximum Number of Edges:\nSince the maximum degree is n−1, if we sum the max degrees: ∑d(vi​)=n(n−1).\nUsing the Handshaking Lemma 2∣E∣=∑d(vi​):\n2∣E∣max​=n(n−1)\n∣E∣max​=2n(n−1)​\nThis is equivalent to choosing 2 vertices out of n to form an edge: (2n​).\n3. Average Degree:\nAvg Degree=n∑d(vi​)​=n2∣E∣​\n4. Degree Inequalities (Theorem 5):\nδ(G)≤n2∣E∣​≤Δ(G)≤n−1\nWhere δ(G) is the minimum degree and Δ(G) is the maximum degree.\n\n4. Degree Sequence\nA degree sequence is the list of degrees of all vertices in the graph, usually written in non-increasing or non-decreasing order.\nGraphical Sequence: A sequence of numbers is called graphical if there exists a simple graph with that degree sequence.\nHavel-Hakimi Algorithm\nA procedure to determine if a sequence is graphical.\nSteps:\n\nSort the sequence in descending order.\nRemove the first element, say k.\nSubtract 1 from the next k elements in the sequence.\nIf negative numbers appear, it’s not graphical.\nIf we reach all zeros, it is graphical.\nSort again and repeat.\n\nExample from notes:\nSequence: 7, 6, 5, 4, 4, 3, 2, 1\n\nRemove 7. Subtract 1 from next 7 elements:\n5, 4, 3, 3, 2, 1, 0\nRemove 5. Subtract 1 from next 5 elements:\n3, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0 (and 0 at end)\nRemove 3. Subtract 1 from next 3 elements:\n1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0\nRemove 1. Subtract 1 from next 1 element:\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n\nResult: All zeros → The sequence is Graphical.\n\n5. Counting Graphs\nTotal number of possible simple graphs with n vertices.\nSince the maximum number of edges is N=2n(n−1)​, and each edge has 2 possibilities (exists or doesn’t exist):\nTotal Simple Graphs=2N=22n(n−1)​\n(Note provided example: 26 likely refers to a case where max edges = 6, i.e., n=4)\n6. Special Types of Graphs\n6.1 Complete Graph (Kn​)\nA simple graph where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge.\n\nDegree: Every vertex has degree n−1.\nNumber of Edges: Since every vertex connects to every other:\n∣E∣=(2n​)=2n(n−1)​\n\n6.2 Regular Graph\nA graph where every vertex has the same degree k. Such a graph is called k-regular.\n\nProperties:\n\nδ(G)=Δ(G)=k\nFrom Handshaking Lemma: n×k=2∣E∣⟹∣E∣=2nk​\n\n\nExamples:\n\nKn​ is (n−1)-regular.\nCycle graph Cn​ is 2-regular.\nNull graph Nn​ is 0-regular.\n\n\n\n6.3 Cycle Graph (Cn​)\nA graph with n vertices (n≥3) containing a single cycle through all vertices.\n\nStructure: Closed loop.\nRegularity: It is always 2-regular.\nEdges: Number of edges = Number of vertices = n.\n\n6.4 Wheel Graph (Wn​)\nConstructed by taking a Cycle Graph Cn−1​ and adding a new vertex (Hub) connected to all vertices of the cycle.\n\nVertices: n (where n−1 are on the rim, 1 is center). note: n≥4.\nEdges:\n\nRim edges (Cn−1​): n−1\nSpoke edges (Hub to Rim): n−1\nTotal Edges: 2(n−1)\n\n\nDegrees:\n\nDegree of Hub: n−1\nDegree of Rim vertices: 3\n\n\n\n6.5 Bipartite Graph\nA graph where the vertex set V can be partitioned into two disjoint sets V1​ and V2​ such that every edge connects a vertex in V1​ to one in V2​.\n\nNo Internal Edges: No edge connects two vertices within the same set (V1​ or V2​).\nTheorem: A graph is bipartite if and only if it contains no odd length cycles.\nComplete Bipartite Graph (Km,n​):\n\nEvery vertex in V1​ (size m) is connected to every vertex in V2​ (size n).\nTotal Vertices: m+n\nTotal Edges: m×n\n\n\n\n6.6 Hypercube Graph (Qn​)\nAlso known as an n-cube.\n\nVertices: 2n vertices, each labeled with a distinct n-bit binary string.\nEdges: Two vertices are connected if their binary strings differ by exactly one bit.\nProperties:\n\nRegularity: It is n-regular (each vertex has n neighbors).\nEdges: using Handshaking Lemma: 2∣E∣=V×degree=2n×n⟹∣E∣=n2n−1.\nBipartite: All hypercubes are bipartite graphs.\n\n\n\n6.7 Complement Graph (Gˉ)\nThe complement of a graph G has the same vertex set as G. Two vertices are adjacent in Gˉ if and only if they are not adjacent in G.\n\nUnion: G∪Gˉ=Kn​ (Complete Graph).\nEdges: ∣E(G)∣+∣E(Gˉ)∣=2n(n−1)​.\n\n6.8 Self-Complement Graph\nA graph that is isomorphic to its own complement (G≅Gˉ).\n\nEdge Count:\n∣E(G)∣=∣E(Gˉ)∣⟹2∣E∣=2n(n−1)​⟹∣E∣=4n(n−1)​\nExistence Condition: For a self-complement graph to exist, the number of vertices n must satisfy n≡0(mod4) or n≡1(mod4).\n\n6.9 Line Graph L(G)\nThe line graph L(G) of a graph G is a graph where:\n\nEach vertex of L(G) represents an edge of G.\nTwo vertices of L(G) are adjacent if their corresponding edges in G share a common endpoint (are incident).\n"},"DM/long/Graph_Theory_Connectivity":{"slug":"DM/long/Graph_Theory_Connectivity","filePath":"DM/long/Graph_Theory_Connectivity.md","title":"Graph_Theory_Connectivity","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Graph Theory - Connectivity\nDate: 29/01/2026\n1.

Connected vs Disconnected Graphs\n\nConnected Graph: A graph is connected if there is a path between every pair of distinct vertices.\nDisconnected Graph: A graph that is not connected. It consists of two or more disjoint connected subgraphs called Components.\n\nComponents\n\nA Component is a maximal connected subgraph.\nA disconnected graph G is essentially a set of components (k≥2).\n\nConnectivity &amp; Complements (Theorems)\nLet G be a graph and Gˉ (or G′) be its complement.\n\nStatement 1: If G is connected, then Gˉ is connected. → FALSE\n\nCounter-example: C4​ is connected, C4​ˉ​=2K2​ (disconnected).\n\n\nStatement 2: If G is disconnected, then Gˉ is always connected. → TRUE\n\nLogic: If u,v are in different components in G, they are not connected. Thus, in Gˉ, there MUST be an edge between them. If they are in the same component, they can reach each other via nodes in other components.\n\n\n\nMinimum Degree &amp; Connectivity\n\n\nTheorem: If δ(G)≥2n−1​, then G is connected.\n-This ensures enough edges to force overlap between neighborhoods of any two vertices.\n\n\nTheorem (Odd Degree Pair): If a graph has exactly two vertices of odd degree (a and b), then there is always a path between a and b.\n\nConsequence: They must belong to the same component. You cannot have one odd degree node in one component and one in another (Handshaking Lemma violation per component).\n\n\n\n\n3. Range of Edges\nFor a Connected Graph with n vertices:\n\nMin Edges: n−1 (Tree structure).\nMax Edges: 2n(n−1)​ (Kn​).\nn−1≤∣E∣≤(2n​)\n\nFor a Disconnected Graph with n vertices and k components:\n\nMin Edges: n−k (Forest with k trees).\nMax Edges: Occurs when one component is Kn−k+1​ and the rest are isolated vertices (K1​).\n\nMax edges = Edges in Kn−k+1​\n∣E∣max​=2(n−k)(n−k+1)​\n\n\n\nn−k≤∣E∣≤2(n−k)(n−k+1)​\nTree Definition\n\nA Tree is a connected graph with no cycles.\nIt uses the minimum number of edges (n−1) to keep n vertices connected.\nA Forest is a collection of trees (disconnected acyclic graph).\n\n\n4. Cut Sets and Connectivity\n4.1 Cut Edge (Bridge)\n\nDefinition: An edge whose removal increases the number of components (makes the graph disconnected).\nCondition: An edge e is a bridge if and only if e is not part of any cycle.\n\n4.2 Cut Vertex (Articulation Point)\n\nDefinition: A vertex whose removal (along with incident edges) increases the number of components.\nNote: If a Cut Edge exists, a Cut Vertex may or may not exist?\n\nActually, if n&gt;2, endpoints of a bridge are cut vertices (unless they are leaves).\nCorrection from notes: “if cut edge exists then cut point may not exist” → This is true for K2​ (single edge). Removing the edge disconnects it. Removing a vertex leaves a single vertex (connected trivial graph) or empty. Technically removal of vertex v from K2​ leaves K1​ (connected). So yes, K2​ has a bridge but no cut vertex.\n\n\n\n4.3 Connectivity Measures\n\nEdge Connectivity (λ(G)): Min number of edges to remove to disconnect G.\nVertex Connectivity (κ(G)): Min number of vertices to remove to disconnect G (or leave a singleton).\n\n4.4 The Great Inequality\nκ(G)≤λ(G)≤δ(G)≤n2∣E∣​≤Δ(G)≤n−1\n\nVertex Connectivity ≤ Edge Connectivity ≤ Min Degree ≤ Avg Degree ≤ Max Degree.\n\n\n5. Problem Solving: Complement of Graph Join\nQuestion: Take Cycle Graph C3​, connect it with Wheel Graph W4​, and then complement it. How many components do we get?\nInterpretation:\n\n“Connect with” usually implies a Graph Join (G1​+G2​), where every vertex of G1​ is connected to every vertex of G2​.\nLet G=C3​+W4​.\nWe need to find components of Gˉ (Complement of G).\n\nTheorem regarding Join Complements:\n\nG1​+G2​​=G1​ˉ​∪G2​ˉ​\nThe complement of a join is the disjoint union of the complements of the individual graphs.\nSo, Components(Gˉ) = Components(C3​ˉ​) + Components(W4​ˉ​).\n\nStep 1: Analyze C3​\n\nC3​ is a triangle (K3​).\nComplement of K3​ (K3​ˉ​) is 3 isolated vertices.\nComponents in C3​ˉ​ = 3.\n\nStep 2: Analyze W4​\n\nW4​ usually means 5 vertices (1 Hub + 4 Rim).\n\nRim is C4​. Hub connected to all 4 rim vertices.\nW4​=C4​+K1​ (Join of Cycle and Single Node).\n\n\nTo find W4​ˉ​:\n\nC4​+K1​​=C4​ˉ​∪K1​ˉ​.\nK1​ˉ​ is just an isolated vertex (C=1).\nC4​ˉ​ (Complement of square cycle):\n\nIn C4​, edges are (1,2),(2,3),(3,4),(4,1).\nIn C4​ˉ​, edges are the diagonals (1,3) and (2,4).\nThis forms two disjoint edges (2K2​).\nComponents in C4​ˉ​ = 2.\n\n\nTotal Components in W4​ˉ​=2+1=3.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Total Components\n\nComponents(Gˉ) = Components(C3​ˉ​) + Components(W4​ˉ​)\nTotal = 3+3=6.\n\nAnswer: 6 Components.\nVisual Representation\n1.

Code of Conduct\n1. Purpose\nA primary goal of the Quartz community is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).\nThis code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.\nWe invite all those who participate in the Quartz community to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.\n2. Open [Source/Culture/Tech] Citizenship\nA supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open [source/culture/tech] citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.\nCommunities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.\nIf you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.\n3. Expected Behavior\nThe following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:\n\nParticipate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.\nExercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.\nAttempt collaboration before conflict.\nRefrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.\nBe mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.\nRemember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.\n\n4. Unacceptable Behavior\nThe following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:\n\nViolence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.\nSexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.\nPosting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.\nPosting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”).\nPersonal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.\nInappropriate photography or recording.\nInappropriate physical contact. You should have someone’s consent before touching them.\nUnwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.\nDeliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).\nAdvocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.\nSustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.\n\n5. Weapons Policy\nNo weapons will be allowed at Quartz community events, community spaces, or in other spaces covered by the scope of this Code of Conduct. Weapons include but are not limited to guns, explosives (including fireworks), and large knives such as those used for hunting or display, as well as any other item used for the purpose of causing injury or harm to others. Anyone seen in possession of one of these items will be asked to leave immediately, and will only be allowed to return without the weapon. Community members are further expected to comply with all state and local laws on this matter.\n6. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior\nUnacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.\nAnyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.\nIf a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).\n7. Reporting Guidelines\nIf you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. j.zhao2k19@gmail.com.\nAdditionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.\n8. Addressing Grievances\nIf you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify @jackyzha0 with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.\n9. Scope\nWe expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues—online and in-person—as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.\nThis code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.\n10.

Additionally, we bundle ‘inline’ client-side scripts (any .inline.ts file) that components declare using a custom esbuild plugin that runs another instance of esbuild which bundles for the browser instead of node. Modules of both types are imported as plain text.\nRunning the local preview server if --serve is set. This starts two servers:\n\nA WebSocket server on port 3001 to handle hot-reload signals. This tracks all inbound connections and sends a ‘rebuild’ message a server-side change is detected (either content or configuration).\nAn HTTP file-server on a user defined port (normally 8080) to serve the actual website files.\n\n\nIf the --serve flag is set, it also starts a file watcher to detect source-code changes (e.g. anything that is .ts, .tsx, .scss, or packager files). On a change, we rebuild the module (step 2 above) using esbuild’s rebuild API which drastically reduces the build times.\nAfter transpiling the main Quartz build module (quartz/build.ts), we write it to a cache file .quartz-cache/transpiled-build.mjs and then dynamically import this using await import(cacheFile). However, we need to be pretty smart about how to bust Node’s import cache so we add a random query string to fake Node into thinking it’s a new module. This does, however, cause memory leaks so we just hope that the user doesn’t hot-reload their configuration too many times in a single session :)) (it leaks about ~350kB memory on each reload). After importing the module, we then invoke it, passing in the command line arguments we parsed earlier along with a callback function to signal the client to refresh.\n\n\nIn build.ts, we start by installing source map support manually to account for the query string cache busting hack we introduced earlier. Then, we start processing content:\n\nClean the output directory.\nRecursively glob all files in the content folder, respecting the .gitignore.\nParse the Markdown files.\n\nQuartz detects the number of threads available and chooses to spawn worker threads if there are &gt;128 pieces of content to parse (rough heuristic). If it needs to spawn workers, it will invoke esbuild again to transpile the worker script quartz/worker.ts. Then, a work-stealing workerpool is then created and batches of 128 files are assigned to workers.\nEach worker (or just the main thread if there is no concurrency) creates a unified parser based off of the plugins defined in the configuration.\nParsing has three steps:\n\nRead the file into a vfile.\nApplied plugin-defined text transformations over the content.\nSlugify the file path and store it in the data for the file. See the page on paths for more details about how path logic works in Quartz (spoiler: its complicated).\nMarkdown parsing using remark-parse (text to mdast).\nApply plugin-defined Markdown-to-Markdown transformations.\nConvert Markdown into HTML using remark-rehype (mdast to hast).\nApply plugin-defined HTML-to-HTML transformations.\n\n\n\n\nFilter out unwanted content using plugins.\nEmit files using plugins.\n\nGather all the static resources (e.g. external CSS, JS modules, etc.) each emitter plugin declares.\nEmitters that emit HTML files do a bit of extra work here as they need to transform the hast produced in the parse step to JSX. This is done using hast-util-to-jsx-runtime with the Preact runtime. Finally, the JSX is rendered to HTML using preact-render-to-string which statically renders the JSX to HTML (i.e. doesn’t care about useState, useEffect, or any other React/Preact interactive bits). Here, we also do a bunch of fun stuff like assemble the page layout from quartz.layout.ts, assemble all the inline scripts that actually get shipped to the client, and all the transpiled styles. The bulk of this logic can be found in quartz/components/renderPage.tsx. Other fun things of note:\n\nCSS is minified and transformed using Lightning CSS to add vendor prefixes and do syntax lowering.\nScripts are split into beforeDOMLoaded and afterDOMLoaded and are inserted in the &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt; respectively.\n\n\nFinally, each emitter plugin is responsible for emitting and writing it’s own emitted files to disk.\n\n\nIf the --serve flag was detected, we also set up another file watcher to detect content changes (only .md files). We keep a content map that tracks the parsed AST and plugin data for each slug and update this on file changes. Newly added or modified paths are rebuilt and added to the content map. Then, all the filters and emitters are run over the resulting content map. This file watcher is debounced with a threshold of 250ms. On success, we send a client refresh signal using the passed in callback function.\n\n\n\nOn the client\n\nThe browser opens a Quartz page and loads the HTML. The &lt;head&gt; also links to page styles (emitted to public/index.css) and page-critical JS (emitted to public/prescript.js)\nThen, once the body is loaded, the browser loads the non-critical JS (emitted to public/postscript.js)\nOnce the page is done loading, the page will then dispatch a custom synthetic browser event &quot;nav&quot;. This is used so client-side scripts declared by components can ‘setup’ anything that requires access to the page DOM.\n\nIf the enableSPA option is enabled in the configuration, this &quot;nav&quot; event is also fired on any client-navigation to allow for components to unregister and reregister any event handlers and state.\nIf it’s not, we wire up the &quot;nav&quot; event to just be fired a single time after page load to allow for consistency across how state is setup across both SPA and non-SPA contexts.\n\n\n\nThe architecture and design of the plugin system was intentionally left pretty vague here as this is described in much more depth in the guide on making your own plugin."},"quartz/docs/advanced/creating-components":{"slug":"quartz/docs/advanced/creating-components","filePath":"quartz/docs/advanced/creating components.md","title":"Creating your own Quartz components","links":["quartz/docs/advanced/making-plugins","quartz/docs/features/SPA-Routing","quartz/docs/configuration"],"tags":[],"content":"\n\n                  \n                  Warning\n                  \n                \n\nThis guide assumes you have experience writing JavaScript and are familiar with TypeScript.\n\n\nNormally on the web, we write layout code using HTML which looks something like the following:\n&lt;article&gt;\n  &lt;h1&gt;An article header&lt;/h1&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Some content&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/article&gt;\nThis piece of HTML represents an article with a leading header that says “An article header” and a paragraph that contains the text “Some content”. This is combined with CSS to style the page and JavaScript to add interactivity.\nHowever, HTML doesn’t let you create reusable templates. If you wanted to create a new page, you would need to copy and paste the above snippet and edit the header and content yourself. This isn’t great if we have a lot of content on our site that shares a lot of similar layout. The smart people who created React also had similar complaints and invented the concept of Components — JavaScript functions that return JSX — to solve the code duplication problem.\nIn effect, components allow you to write a JavaScript function that takes some data and produces HTML as an output. While Quartz doesn’t use React, it uses the same component concept to allow you to easily express layout templates in your Quartz site.\nAn Example Component\nConstructor\nComponent files are written in .tsx files that live in the quartz/components folder. These are re-exported in quartz/components/index.ts so you can use them in layouts and other components more easily.\nEach component file should have a default export that satisfies the QuartzComponentConstructor function signature. It’s a function that takes in a single optional parameter opts and returns a Quartz Component. The type of the parameters opts is defined by the interface Options which you as the component creator also decide.\nIn your component, you can use the values from the configuration option to change the rendering behaviour inside of your component. For example, the component in the code snippet below will not render if the favouriteNumber option is below 0.\ninterface Options {\n  favouriteNumber: number\n}\n \nconst defaultOptions: Options = {\n  favouriteNumber: 42,\n}\n \nexport default ((userOpts?: Options) =&gt; {\n  const opts = { ...userOpts, ...defaultOpts }\n  function YourComponent(props: QuartzComponentProps) {\n    if (opts.favouriteNumber &lt; 0) {\n      return null\n    }\n \n    return &lt;p&gt;My favourite number is {opts.favouriteNumber}&lt;/p&gt;\n  }\n \n  return YourComponent\n}) satisfies QuartzComponentConstructor\nProps\nThe Quartz component itself (lines 11-17 highlighted above) looks like a React component. It takes in properties (sometimes called props) and returns JSX.\nAll Quartz components accept the same set of props:\nquartz/components/types.ts// simplified for sake of demonstration\nexport type QuartzComponentProps = {\n  fileData: QuartzPluginData\n  cfg: GlobalConfiguration\n  tree: Node&lt;QuartzPluginData&gt;\n  allFiles: QuartzPluginData[]\n  displayClass?: &quot;mobile-only&quot; | &quot;desktop-only&quot;\n}\n\nfileData: Any metadata plugins may have added to the current page.\n\nfileData.slug: slug of the current page.\nfileData.frontmatter: any frontmatter parsed.\n\n\ncfg: The configuration field in quartz.config.ts.\ntree: the resulting HTML AST after processing and transforming the file. This is useful if you’d like to render the content using hast-util-to-jsx-runtime (you can find an example of this in quartz/components/pages/Content.tsx).\nallFiles: Metadata for all files that have been parsed. Useful for doing page listings or figuring out the overall site structure.\ndisplayClass: a utility class that indicates a preference from the user about how to render it in a mobile or desktop setting. Helpful if you want to conditionally hide a component on mobile or desktop.\n\nStyling\nQuartz components can also define a .css property on the actual function component which will get picked up by Quartz. This is expected to be a CSS string which can either be inlined or imported from a .scss file.\nNote that inlined styles must be plain vanilla CSS:\nquartz/components/YourComponent.tsxexport default (() =&gt; {\n  function YourComponent() {\n    return &lt;p class=&quot;red-text&quot;&gt;Example Component&lt;/p&gt;\n  }\n \n  YourComponent.css = `\n  p.red-text {\n    color: red;\n  }\n  `\n \n  return YourComponent\n}) satisfies QuartzComponentConstructor\nImported styles, however, can be from SCSS files:\nquartz/components/YourComponent.tsx// assuming your stylesheet is in quartz/components/styles/YourComponent.scss\nimport styles from &quot;./styles/YourComponent.scss&quot;\n \nexport default (() =&gt; {\n  function YourComponent() {\n    return &lt;p&gt;Example Component&lt;/p&gt;\n  }\n \n  YourComponent.css = styles\n  return YourComponent\n}) satisfies QuartzComponentConstructor\n\n\n                  \n                  Warning\n                  \n                \n\nQuartz does not use CSS modules so any styles you declare here apply globally. If you only want it to apply to your component, make sure you use specific class names and selectors.\n\n\nScripts and Interactivity\nWhat about interactivity? Suppose you want to add an-click handler for example. Like the .css property on the component, you can also declare .beforeDOMLoaded and .afterDOMLoaded properties that are strings that contain the script.\nquartz/components/YourComponent.tsxexport default (() =&gt; {\n  function YourComponent() {\n    return &lt;button id=&quot;btn&quot;&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;\n  }\n \n  YourComponent.beforeDOMLoaded = `\n  console.log(&quot;hello from before the page loads!&quot;)\n  `\n \n  YourComponent.afterDOMLoaded = `\n  document.getElementById(&#039;btn&#039;).onclick = () =&gt; {\n    alert(&#039;button clicked!&#039;)\n  }\n  `\n  return YourComponent\n}) satisfies QuartzComponentConstructor\n\n\n                  \n                  Hint\n                  \n                \n\nFor those coming from React, Quartz components are different from React components in that it only uses JSX for templating and layout. Hooks like useEffect, useState, etc. are not rendered and other properties that accept functions like onClick handlers will not work. Instead, do it using a regular JS script that modifies the DOM element directly.\n\n\nAs the names suggest, the .beforeDOMLoaded scripts are executed before the page is done loading so it doesn’t have access to any elements on the page. This is mostly used to prefetch any critical data.\nThe .afterDOMLoaded script executes once the page has been completely loaded. This is a good place to setup anything that should last for the duration of a site visit (e.g. getting something saved from local storage).\nIf you need to create an afterDOMLoaded script that depends on page specific elements that may change when navigating to a new page, you can listen for the &quot;nav&quot; event that gets fired whenever a page loads (which may happen on navigation if SPA Routing is enabled).\ndocument.addEventListener(&quot;nav&quot;, () =&gt; {\n  // do page specific logic here\n  // e.g. attach event listeners\n  const toggleSwitch = document.querySelector(&quot;#switch&quot;) as HTMLInputElement\n  toggleSwitch.addEventListener(&quot;change&quot;, switchTheme)\n  window.addCleanup(() =&gt; toggleSwitch.removeEventListener(&quot;change&quot;, switchTheme))\n})\nYou can also add the equivalent of a beforeunload event for SPA Routing via the prenav event.\ndocument.addEventListener(&quot;prenav&quot;, () =&gt; {\n  // executed after an SPA navigation is triggered but\n  // before the page is replaced\n  // one usage pattern is to store things in sessionStorage\n  // in the prenav and then conditionally load then in the consequent\n  // nav\n})\nIt is best practice to track any event handlers via window.addCleanup to prevent memory leaks.\nThis will get called on page navigation.\nImporting Code\nOf course, it isn’t always practical (nor desired!) to write your code as a string literal in the component.\nQuartz supports importing component code through .inline.ts files.\nquartz/components/YourComponent.tsx// @ts-ignore: typescript doesn&#039;t know about our inline bundling system\n// so we need to silence the error\nimport script from &quot;./scripts/graph.inline&quot;\n \nexport default (() =&gt; {\n  function YourComponent() {\n    return &lt;button id=&quot;btn&quot;&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;\n  }\n \n  YourComponent.afterDOMLoaded = script\n  return YourComponent\n}) satisfies QuartzComponentConstructor\nquartz/components/scripts/graph.inline.ts// any imports here are bundled for the browser\nimport * as d3 from &quot;d3&quot;\n \ndocument.getElementById(&quot;btn&quot;).onclick = () =&gt; {\n  alert(&quot;button clicked!&quot;)\n}\nAdditionally, like what is shown in the example above, you can import packages in .inline.ts files. This will be bundled by Quartz and included in the actual script.\nUsing a Component\nAfter creating your custom component, re-export it in quartz/components/index.ts:\nquartz/components/index.tsimport ArticleTitle from &quot;./ArticleTitle&quot;\nimport Content from &quot;./pages/Content&quot;\nimport Darkmode from &quot;./Darkmode&quot;\nimport YourComponent from &quot;./YourComponent&quot;\n \nexport { ArticleTitle, Content, Darkmode, YourComponent }\nThen, you can use it like any other component in quartz.layout.ts via Component.YourComponent(). See the layout section for more details.\nAs Quartz components are just functions that return React components, you can compositionally use them in other Quartz components.\nquartz/components/AnotherComponent.tsximport YourComponentConstructor from &quot;./YourComponent&quot;\n \nexport default (() =&gt; {\n  const YourComponent = YourComponentConstructor()\n \n  function AnotherComponent(props: QuartzComponentProps) {\n    return (\n      &lt;div&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;It&#039;s nested!&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;YourComponent {...props} /&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n    )\n  }\n \n  return AnotherComponent\n}) satisfies QuartzComponentConstructor\n\n\n                  \n                  Hint\n                  \n                \n\nLook in quartz/components for more examples of components in Quartz as reference for your own components!\n\n"},"quartz/docs/advanced/index":{"slug":"quartz/docs/advanced/index","filePath":"quartz/docs/advanced/index.md","title":"Advanced","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"quartz/docs/advanced/making-plugins":{"slug":"quartz/docs/advanced/making-plugins","filePath":"quartz/docs/advanced/making plugins.md","title":"Making your own plugins","links":["quartz/docs/build","quartz/docs/configuration","quartz/docs/advanced/paths","plugins/Latex","quartz/docs/advanced/creating-components"],"tags":[],"content":"\n\n                  \n                  Warning\n                  \n                \n\nThis part of the documentation will assume you have working knowledge in TypeScript and will include code snippets that describe the interface of what Quartz plugins should look like.\n\n\nQuartz’s plugins are a series of transformations over content. This is illustrated in the diagram of the processing pipeline below:\n\nAll plugins are defined as a function that takes in a single parameter for options type OptionType = object | undefined and return an object that corresponds to the type of plugin it is.\ntype OptionType = object | undefined\ntype QuartzPlugin&lt;Options extends OptionType = undefined&gt; = (opts?: Options) =&gt; QuartzPluginInstance\ntype QuartzPluginInstance =\n  | QuartzTransformerPluginInstance\n  | QuartzFilterPluginInstance\n  | QuartzEmitterPluginInstance\nThe following sections will go into detail for what methods can be implemented for each plugin type. Before we do that, let’s clarify a few more ambiguous types:\n\nBuildCtx is defined in quartz/ctx.ts. It consists of\n\nargv: The command line arguments passed to the Quartz build command\ncfg: The full Quartz configuration\nallSlugs: a list of all the valid content slugs (see paths for more information on what a slug is)\n\n\nStaticResources is defined in quartz/resources.tsx. It consists of\n\ncss: a list of CSS style definitions that should be loaded. A CSS style is described with the CSSResource type which is also defined in quartz/resources.tsx. It accepts either a source URL or the inline content of the stylesheet.\njs: a list of scripts that should be loaded. A script is described with the JSResource type which is also defined in quartz/resources.tsx. It allows you to define a load time (either before or after the DOM has been loaded), whether it should be a module, and either the source URL or the inline content of the script.\nadditionalHead: a list of JSX elements or functions that return JSX elements to be added to the &lt;head&gt; tag of the page. Functions receive the page’s data as an argument and can conditionally render elements.\n\n\n\nTransformers\nTransformers map over content, taking a Markdown file and outputting modified content or adding metadata to the file itself.\nexport type QuartzTransformerPluginInstance = {\n  name: string\n  textTransform?: (ctx: BuildCtx, src: string) =&gt; string\n  markdownPlugins?: (ctx: BuildCtx) =&gt; PluggableList\n  htmlPlugins?: (ctx: BuildCtx) =&gt; PluggableList\n  externalResources?: (ctx: BuildCtx) =&gt; Partial&lt;StaticResources&gt;\n}\nAll transformer plugins must define at least a name field to register the plugin and a few optional functions that allow you to hook into various parts of transforming a single Markdown file.\n\ntextTransform performs a text-to-text transformation before a file is parsed into the Markdown AST.\nmarkdownPlugins defines a list of remark plugins. remark is a tool that transforms Markdown to Markdown in a structured way.\nhtmlPlugins defines a list of rehype plugins. Similar to how remark works, rehype is a tool that transforms HTML to HTML in a structured way.\nexternalResources defines any external resources the plugin may need to load on the client-side for it to work properly.\n\nNormally for both remark and rehype, you can find existing plugins that you can use to . If you’d like to create your own remark or rehype plugin, checkout the guide to creating a plugin using unified (the underlying AST parser and transformer library).\nA good example of a transformer plugin that borrows from the remark and rehype ecosystems is the Latex plugin:\nquartz/plugins/transformers/latex.tsimport remarkMath from &quot;remark-math&quot;\nimport rehypeKatex from &quot;rehype-katex&quot;\nimport rehypeMathjax from &quot;rehype-mathjax/svg&quot;\nimport { QuartzTransformerPlugin } from &quot;../types&quot;\n \ninterface Options {\n  renderEngine: &quot;katex&quot; | &quot;mathjax&quot;\n}\n \nexport const Latex: QuartzTransformerPlugin&lt;Options&gt; = (opts?: Options) =&gt; {\n  const engine = opts?.renderEngine ?? &quot;katex&quot;\n  return {\n    name: &quot;Latex&quot;,\n    markdownPlugins() {\n      return [remarkMath]\n    },\n    htmlPlugins() {\n      if (engine === &quot;katex&quot;) {\n        // if you need to pass options into a plugin, you\n        // can use a tuple of [plugin, options]\n        return [[rehypeKatex, { output: &quot;html&quot; }]]\n      } else {\n        return [rehypeMathjax]\n      }\n    },\n    externalResources() {\n      if (engine === &quot;katex&quot;) {\n        return {\n          css: [\n            {\n              // base css\n              content: &quot;cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/KaTeX/0.16.9/katex.min.css&quot;,\n            },\n          ],\n          js: [\n            {\n              // fix copy behaviour: github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX/blob/main/contrib/copy-tex/README.md\n              src: &quot;cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/KaTeX/0.16.9/contrib/copy-tex.min.js&quot;,\n              loadTime: &quot;afterDOMReady&quot;,\n              contentType: &quot;external&quot;,\n            },\n          ],\n        }\n      }\n    },\n  }\n}\nAnother common thing that transformer plugins will do is parse a file and add extra data for that file:\nexport const AddWordCount: QuartzTransformerPlugin = () =&gt; {\n  return {\n    name: &quot;AddWordCount&quot;,\n    markdownPlugins() {\n      return [\n        () =&gt; {\n          return (tree, file) =&gt; {\n            // tree is an `mdast` root element\n            // file is a `vfile`\n            const text = file.value\n            const words = text.split(&quot; &quot;).length\n            file.data.wordcount = words\n          }\n        },\n      ]\n    },\n  }\n}\n \n// tell typescript about our custom data fields we are adding\n// other plugins will then also be aware of this data field\ndeclare module &quot;vfile&quot; {\n  interface DataMap {\n    wordcount: number\n  }\n}\nFinally, you can also perform transformations over Markdown or HTML ASTs using the visit function from the unist-util-visit package or the findAndReplace function from the mdast-util-find-and-replace package.\nexport const TextTransforms: QuartzTransformerPlugin = () =&gt; {\n  return {\n    name: &quot;TextTransforms&quot;,\n    markdownPlugins() {\n      return [() =&gt; {\n        return (tree, file) =&gt; {\n          // replace _text_ with the italics version\n          findAndReplace(tree, /_(.+)_/, (_value: string, ...capture: string[]) =&gt; {\n            // inner is the text inside of the () of the regex\n            const [inner] = capture\n            // return an mdast node\n            // github.com/syntax-tree/mdast\n            return {\n              type: &quot;emphasis&quot;,\n              children: [{ type: &#039;text&#039;, value: inner }]\n            }\n          })\n \n         // remove all links (replace with just the link content)\n         // match by &#039;type&#039; field on an mdast node\n         // github.com/syntax-tree/mdast#link in this example\n          visit(tree, &quot;link&quot;, (link: Link) =&gt; {\n            return {\n              type: &quot;paragraph&quot;\n              children: [{ type: &#039;text&#039;, value: link.title }]\n            }\n          })\n        }\n      }]\n    }\n  }\n}\nAll transformer plugins can be found under quartz/plugins/transformers. If you decide to write your own transformer plugin, don’t forget to re-export it under quartz/plugins/transformers/index.ts\nA parting word: transformer plugins are quite complex so don’t worry if you don’t get them right away. Take a look at the built in transformers and see how they operate over content to get a better sense for how to accomplish what you are trying to do.\nFilters\nFilters filter content, taking the output of all the transformers and determining what files to actually keep and what to discard.\nexport type QuartzFilterPlugin&lt;Options extends OptionType = undefined&gt; = (\n  opts?: Options,\n) =&gt; QuartzFilterPluginInstance\n \nexport type QuartzFilterPluginInstance = {\n  name: string\n  shouldPublish(ctx: BuildCtx, content: ProcessedContent): boolean\n}\nA filter plugin must define a name field and a shouldPublish function that takes in a piece of content that has been processed by all the transformers and returns a true or false depending on whether it should be passed to the emitter plugins or not.\nFor example, here is the built-in plugin for removing drafts:\nquartz/plugins/filters/draft.tsimport { QuartzFilterPlugin } from &quot;../types&quot;\n \nexport const RemoveDrafts: QuartzFilterPlugin&lt;{}&gt; = () =&gt; ({\n  name: &quot;RemoveDrafts&quot;,\n  shouldPublish(_ctx, [_tree, vfile]) {\n    // uses frontmatter parsed from transformers\n    const draftFlag: boolean = vfile.data?.draft ?? false\n    return !draftFlag\n  },\n})\nEmitters\nEmitters reduce over content, taking in a list of all the transformed and filtered content and creating output files.\nexport type QuartzEmitterPlugin&lt;Options extends OptionType = undefined&gt; = (\n  opts?: Options,\n) =&gt; QuartzEmitterPluginInstance\n \nexport type QuartzEmitterPluginInstance = {\n  name: string\n  emit(\n    ctx: BuildCtx,\n    content: ProcessedContent[],\n    resources: StaticResources,\n  ): Promise&lt;FilePath[]&gt; | AsyncGenerator&lt;FilePath&gt;\n  partialEmit?(\n    ctx: BuildCtx,\n    content: ProcessedContent[],\n    resources: StaticResources,\n    changeEvents: ChangeEvent[],\n  ): Promise&lt;FilePath[]&gt; | AsyncGenerator&lt;FilePath&gt; | null\n  getQuartzComponents(ctx: BuildCtx): QuartzComponent[]\n}\nAn emitter plugin must define a name field, an emit function, and a getQuartzComponents function. It can optionally implement a partialEmit function for incremental builds.\n\nemit is responsible for looking at all the parsed and filtered content and then appropriately creating files and returning a list of paths to files the plugin created.\npartialEmit is an optional function that enables incremental builds. It receives information about which files have changed (changeEvents) and can selectively rebuild only the necessary files. This is useful for optimizing build times in development mode. If partialEmit is undefined, it will default to the emit function.\ngetQuartzComponents declares which Quartz components the emitter uses to construct its pages.\n\nCreating new files can be done via regular Node fs module (i.e. fs.cp or fs.writeFile) or via the write function in quartz/plugins/emitters/helpers.ts if you are creating files that contain text. write has the following signature:\nexport type WriteOptions = (data: {\n  // the build context\n  ctx: BuildCtx\n  // the name of the file to emit (not including the file extension)\n  slug: FullSlug\n  // the file extension\n  ext: `.${string}` | &quot;&quot;\n  // the file content to add\n  content: string\n}) =&gt; Promise&lt;FilePath&gt;\nThis is a thin wrapper around writing to the appropriate output folder and ensuring that intermediate directories exist. If you choose to use the native Node fs APIs, ensure you emit to the argv.output folder as well.\nIf you are creating an emitter plugin that needs to render components, there are three more things to be aware of:\n\nYour component should use getQuartzComponents to declare a list of QuartzComponents that it uses to construct the page. See the page on creating components for more information.\nYou can use the renderPage function defined in quartz/components/renderPage.tsx to render Quartz components into HTML.\nIf you need to render an HTML AST to JSX, you can use the htmlToJsx function from quartz/util/jsx.ts. An example of this can be found in quartz/components/pages/Content.tsx.\n\nFor example, the following is a simplified version of the content page plugin that renders every single page.\nquartz/plugins/emitters/contentPage.tsxexport const ContentPage: QuartzEmitterPlugin = () =&gt; {\n  // construct the layout\n  const layout: FullPageLayout = {\n    ...sharedPageComponents,\n    ...defaultContentPageLayout,\n    pageBody: Content(),\n  }\n  const { head, header, beforeBody, pageBody, afterBody, left, right, footer } = layout\n  return {\n    name: &quot;ContentPage&quot;,\n    getQuartzComponents() {\n      return [head, ...header, ...beforeBody, pageBody, ...afterBody, ...left, ...right, footer]\n    },\n    async emit(ctx, content, resources, emit): Promise&lt;FilePath[]&gt; {\n      const cfg = ctx.cfg.configuration\n      const fps: FilePath[] = []\n      const allFiles = content.map((c) =&gt; c[1].data)\n      for (const [tree, file] of content) {\n        const slug = canonicalizeServer(file.data.slug!)\n        const externalResources = pageResources(slug, file.data, resources)\n        const componentData: QuartzComponentProps = {\n          fileData: file.data,\n          externalResources,\n          cfg,\n          children: [],\n          tree,\n          allFiles,\n        }\n \n        const content = renderPage(cfg, slug, componentData, opts, externalResources)\n        const fp = await emit({\n          content,\n          slug: file.data.slug!,\n          ext: &quot;.html&quot;,\n        })\n \n        fps.push(fp)\n      }\n      return fps\n    },\n  }\n}\nNote that it takes in a FullPageLayout as the options. It’s made by combining a SharedLayout and a PageLayout both of which are provided through the quartz.layout.ts file.\n\n\n                  \n                  Hint\n                  \n                \n\nLook in quartz/plugins for more examples of plugins in Quartz as reference for your own plugins!\n\n"},"quartz/docs/advanced/paths":{"slug":"quartz/docs/advanced/paths","filePath":"quartz/docs/advanced/paths.md","title":"Paths in Quartz","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Paths are pretty complex to reason about because, especially for a static site generator, they can come from so many places.\nA full file path to a piece of content? Also a path. What about a slug for a piece of content? Yet another path.\nIt would be silly to type these all as string and call it a day as it’s pretty common to accidentally mistake one type of path for another. Unfortunately, TypeScript does not have nominal types for type aliases meaning even if you made custom types of a server-side slug or a client-slug slug, you can still accidentally assign one to another and TypeScript wouldn’t catch it.\nLuckily, we can mimic nominal typing using brands.\n// instead of\ntype FullSlug = string\n \n// we do\ntype FullSlug = string &amp; { __brand: &quot;full&quot; }\n \n// that way, the following will fail typechecking\nconst slug: FullSlug = &quot;some random string&quot;\nWhile this prevents most typing mistakes within our nominal typing system (e.g. mistaking a server slug for a client slug), it doesn’t prevent us from accidentally mistaking a string for a client slug when we forcibly cast it.\nThus, we still need to be careful when casting from a string to one of these nominal types in the ‘entrypoints’, illustrated with hexagon shapes in the diagram below.\nThe following diagram draws the relationships between all the path sources, nominal path types, and what functions in quartz/path.ts convert between them.\ngraph LR\n    Browser{{Browser}} --&gt; Window{{Body}} &amp; LinkElement{{Link Element}}\n    Window --&quot;getFullSlug()&quot;--&gt; FullSlug[Full Slug]\n    LinkElement --&quot;.href&quot;--&gt; Relative[Relative URL]\n    FullSlug --&quot;simplifySlug()&quot; --&gt; SimpleSlug[Simple Slug]\n    SimpleSlug --&quot;pathToRoot()&quot;--&gt; Relative\n    SimpleSlug --&quot;resolveRelative()&quot; --&gt; Relative\n    MD{{Markdown File}} --&gt; FilePath{{File Path}} &amp; Links[Markdown links]\n    Links --&quot;transformLink()&quot;--&gt; Relative\n    FilePath --&quot;slugifyFilePath()&quot;--&gt; FullSlug[Full Slug]\n    style FullSlug stroke-width:4px\n\nHere are the main types of slugs with a rough description of each type of path:\n\nFilePath: a real file path to a file on disk. Cannot be relative and must have a file extension.\nFullSlug: cannot be relative and may not have leading or trailing slashes. It can have index as it’s last segment. Use this wherever possible is it’s the most ‘general’ interpretation of a slug.\nSimpleSlug: cannot be relative and shouldn’t have /index as an ending or a file extension. It can however have a trailing slash to indicate a folder path.\nRelativeURL: must start with . or .. to indicate it’s a relative URL. Shouldn’t have /index as an ending or a file extension but can contain a trailing slash.\n\nTo get a clearer picture of how these relate to each other, take a look at the path tests in quartz/util/path.test.ts."},"quartz/docs/authoring-content":{"slug":"quartz/docs/authoring-content","filePath":"quartz/docs/authoring content.md","title":"Authoring Content","links":["/","quartz/docs/build","quartz/docs/features/callouts","quartz/docs/features/wikilinks","quartz/docs/features/private-pages","quartz/docs/plugins/Frontmatter","quartz/docs/setting-up-your-GitHub-repository","quartz/docs/plugins/CreatedModifiedDate","quartz/docs/plugins/Description"],"tags":[],"content":"All of the content in your Quartz should go in the /content folder.

This is normally the deployed URL of your site (e.g. quartz.jzhao.xyz for this site). Do not include the protocol (i.e. https://) or any leading or trailing slashes.\n\nThis should also include the subpath if you are hosting on GitHub pages without a custom domain. For example, if my repository is jackyzha0/quartz, GitHub pages would deploy to jackyzha0.github.io/quartz and the baseUrl would be jackyzha0.github.io/quartz.\nNote that Quartz 4 will avoid using this as much as possible and use relative URLs whenever it can to make sure your site works no matter where you end up actually deploying it.\n\n\nignorePatterns: a list of glob patterns that Quartz should ignore and not search through when looking for files inside the content folder.

This will generally be faster. Disable (false) this if you want Quartz to download the fonts to be self-contained.\ntypography: what fonts to use. Any font available on Google Fonts works here.\n\ntitle: font for the title of the site (optional, same as header by default)\nheader: font to use for headers\ncode: font for inline and block quotes\nbody: font for everything\n\n\ncolors: controls the theming of the site.\n\nlight: page background\nlightgray: borders\ngray: graph links, heavier borders\ndarkgray: body text\ndark: header text and icons\nsecondary: link colour, current graph node\ntertiary: hover states and visited graph nodes\nhighlight: internal link background, highlighted text, highlighted lines of code\ntextHighlight: markdown highlighted text background\n\n\n\n\n\nPlugins\nYou can think of Quartz plugins as a series of transformations over content.\n\nquartz.config.tsplugins: {\n  transformers: [...],\n  filters: [...],\n  emitters: [...],\n}\n\nTransformers map over content (e.g. parsing frontmatter, generating a description)\nFilters filter content (e.g. filtering out drafts)\nEmitters reduce over content (e.g. creating an RSS feed or pages that list all files with a specific tag)\n\nYou can customize the behaviour of Quartz by adding, removing and reordering plugins in the transformers, filters and emitters fields.\n\n\n                  \n                  Note\n                  \n                \n\nEach node is modified by every transformer in order. Some transformers are position sensitive, so you may need to pay particular attention to whether they need to come before or after certain other plugins.\n\n\nYou should take care to add the plugin to the right entry corresponding to its plugin type. For example, to add the ExplicitPublish plugin (a Filter), you would add the following line:\nquartz.config.tsfilters: [\n  ...\n  Plugin.ExplicitPublish(),\n  ...\n],\nTo remove a plugin, you should remove all occurrences of it in the quartz.config.ts.\nTo customize plugins further, some plugins may also have their own configuration settings that you can pass in. If you do not pass in a configuration, the plugin will use its default settings.\nFor example, the Latex plugin allows you to pass in a field specifying the renderEngine to choose between Katex and MathJax.\nquartz.config.tstransformers: [\n  Plugin.FrontMatter(), // use default options\n  Plugin.Latex({ renderEngine: &quot;katex&quot; }), // set some custom options\n]\nSome plugins are included by default in the quartz.config.ts, but there are more available.\nYou can see a list of all plugins and their configuration options here.\nIf you’d like to make your own plugins, see the making custom plugins guide.\nFonts\nFonts can be specified as a string or a FontSpecification:\n// string\ntypography: {\n  header: &quot;Schibsted Grotesk&quot;,\n  ...\n}\n \n// FontSpecification\ntypography: {\n  header: {\n    name: &quot;Schibsted Grotesk&quot;,\n    weights: [400, 700],\n    includeItalic: true,\n  },\n  ...\n}"},"quartz/docs/features/Citations":{"slug":"quartz/docs/features/Citations","filePath":"quartz/docs/features/Citations.md","title":"Citations","links":["plugins/Citations"],"tags":["feature/transformer"],"content":"Quartz uses rehype-citation to support parsing of a BibTex bibliography file.\nUnder the default configuration, a citation key [@templeton2024scaling] will be exported as (Templeton et al., 2024).\n\n\n                  \n                  BibTex file \n                  \n                \n\nbibliography.bib@article{templeton2024scaling,\n  title={Scaling Monosemanticity: Extracting Interpretable Features from Claude 3 Sonnet},\n  author={Templeton, Adly and Conerly, Tom and Marcus, Jonathan and Lindsey, Jack and Bricken, Trenton and Chen, Brian and Pearce, Adam and Citro, Craig and Ameisen, Emmanuel and Jones, Andy and Cunningham, Hoagy and Turner, Nicholas L and McDougall, Callum and MacDiarmid, Monte and Freeman, C.

You can pass a custom sort, filter and map function.\nAll functions you can pass work with the FileTrieNode class, which has the following properties:\nquartz/components/Explorer.tsxclass FileTrieNode {\n  isFolder: boolean\n  children: Array&lt;FileTrieNode&gt;\n  data: ContentDetails | null\n}\nquartz/plugins/emitters/contentIndex.tsxexport type ContentDetails = {\n  slug: FullSlug\n  title: string\n  links: SimpleSlug[]\n  tags: string[]\n  content: string\n}\nEvery function you can pass is optional. By default, only a sort function will be used:\nDefault sort function// Sort order: folders first, then files. Sort folders and files alphabetically\nComponent.Explorer({\n  sortFn: (a, b) =&gt; {\n    if ((!a.isFolder &amp;&amp; !b.isFolder) || (a.isFolder &amp;&amp; b.isFolder)) {\n      return a.displayName.localeCompare(b.displayName, undefined, {\n        numeric: true,\n        sensitivity: &quot;base&quot;,\n      })\n    }\n \n    if (!a.isFolder &amp;&amp; b.isFolder) {\n      return 1\n    } else {\n      return -1\n    }\n  },\n})\n\nYou can pass your own functions for sortFn, filterFn and mapFn. All functions will be executed in the order provided by the order option (see Customization). These functions behave similarly to their Array.prototype counterpart, except they modify the entire FileNode tree in place instead of returning a new one.\nFor more information on how to use sort, filter and map, you can check Array.prototype.sort(), Array.prototype.filter() and Array.prototype.map().\nType definitions look like this:\ntype SortFn = (a: FileTrieNode, b: FileTrieNode) =&gt; number\ntype FilterFn = (node: FileTrieNode) =&gt; boolean\ntype MapFn = (node: FileTrieNode) =&gt; void\nBasic examples\nThese examples show the basic usage of sort, map and filter.\nUse sort to put files first\nUsing this example, the explorer will alphabetically sort everything.\nquartz.layout.tsComponent.Explorer({\n  sortFn: (a, b) =&gt; {\n    return a.displayName.localeCompare(b.displayName)\n  },\n})\nChange display names (map)\nUsing this example, the display names of all FileNodes (folders + files) will be converted to full upper case.\nquartz.layout.tsComponent.Explorer({\n  mapFn: (node) =&gt; {\n    node.displayName = node.displayName.toUpperCase()\n    return node\n  },\n})\nRemove list of elements (filter)\nUsing this example, you can remove elements from your explorer by providing an array of folders/files to exclude.\nNote that this example filters on the title but you can also do it via slug or any other field available on FileTrieNode.\nquartz.layout.tsComponent.Explorer({\n  filterFn: (node) =&gt; {\n    // set containing names of everything you want to filter out\n    const omit = new Set([&quot;authoring content&quot;, &quot;tags&quot;, &quot;advanced&quot;])\n \n    // can also use node.slug or by anything on node.data\n    // note that node.data is only present for files that exist on disk\n    // (e.g. implicit folder nodes that have no associated index.md)\n    return !omit.has(node.displayName.toLowerCase())\n  },\n})\nRemove files by tag\nYou can access the tags of a file by node.data.tags.\nquartz.layout.tsComponent.Explorer({\n  filterFn: (node) =&gt; {\n    // exclude files with the tag &quot;explorerexclude&quot;\n    return node.data?.includes(&quot;explorerexclude&quot;) !== true\n  },\n})\nShow every element in explorer\nBy default, the explorer will filter out the tags folder.\nTo override the default filter function, you can set the filter function to undefined.\nquartz.layout.tsComponent.Explorer({\n  filterFn: undefined, // apply no filter function, every file and folder will visible\n})\nAdvanced examples\n\n\n                  \n                  Tip\n                  \n                \n\nWhen writing more complicated functions, the layout file can start to look very cramped.\nYou can fix this by defining your sort functions outside of the component\nand passing it in.\nquartz.layout.tsimport { Options } from &quot;./quartz/components/Explorer&quot;\n \nexport const mapFn: Options[&quot;mapFn&quot;] = (node) =&gt; {\n  // implement your function here\n}\nexport const filterFn: Options[&quot;filterFn&quot;] = (node) =&gt; {\n  // implement your function here\n}\nexport const sortFn: Options[&quot;sortFn&quot;] = (a, b) =&gt; {\n  // implement your function here\n}\n \nComponent.Explorer({\n  // ... your other options\n  mapFn,\n  filterFn,\n  sortFn,\n})\n\n\nAdd emoji prefix\nTo add emoji prefixes (📁 for folders, 📄 for files), you could use a map function like this:\nquartz.layout.tsComponent.Explorer({\n  mapFn: (node) =&gt; {\n    if (node.isFolder) {\n      node.displayName = &quot;📁 &quot; + node.displayName\n    } else {\n      node.displayName = &quot;📄 &quot; + node.displayName\n    }\n  },\n})"},"quartz/docs/features/folder-and-tag-listings":{"slug":"quartz/docs/features/folder-and-tag-listings","filePath":"quartz/docs/features/folder and tag listings.md","title":"Folder and Tag Listings","links":["advanced/","quartz/docs/authoring-content","tags/plugin","tags/component","quartz/docs/plugins/FolderPage","quartz/docs/plugins/TagPage"],"tags":["feature/emitter","component"],"content":"Quartz emits listing pages for any folders and tags you have.\nFolder Listings\nQuartz will generate an index page for all the pages under that folder.

Any content you write in this file will also be used in the folder description.\nFor example, for the folder content/posts, you can add another file content/posts/index.md to add a specific description for it.\nTag Listings\nQuartz will also create an index page for each unique tag in your vault and render a list of all notes with that tag.\nQuartz also supports tag hierarchies as well (e.g. plugin/emitter) and will also render a separate tag page for each level of the tag hierarchy. It will also create a default global tag index page at /tags that displays a list of all the tags in your Quartz.\nYou can link to the tag listing by referencing its name with a tag/ prefix, like this: [[tags/plugin]] (results in plugin).\nAs with folder listings, you can also provide a description and title for a tag page by creating a file for each tag.

For example, if you want to use the subdomain quartz.example.com for your user site, create a CNAME record that points quartz.example.com to &lt;github-username&gt;.github.io.\n\n\n\nThe above shows a screenshot of Google Domains configured for both jzhao.xyz (an apex domain) and quartz.jzhao.xyz (a subdomain).\nSee the GitHub documentation for more detail about how to setup your own custom domain with GitHub Pages.\n\n\n                  \n                  Why aren&#039;t my changes showing up? \n                  \n                \n\nThere could be many different reasons why your changes aren’t showing up but the most likely reason is that you forgot to push your changes to GitHub.\nMake sure you save your changes to Git and sync it to GitHub by doing npx quartz sync. This will also make sure to pull any updates you may have made from other devices so you have them locally.\n\n\nVercel\nFix URLs\nBefore deploying to Vercel, a vercel.json file is required at the root of the project directory.

These components wrap other components to add additional functionality or modify their behavior.\nFlex Component\nThe Flex component creates a flexible box layout that can arrange child components in various ways. It’s particularly useful for creating responsive layouts and organizing components in rows or columns.\ntype FlexConfig = {\n  components: {\n    Component: QuartzComponent\n    grow?: boolean // whether component should grow to fill space\n    shrink?: boolean // whether component should shrink if needed\n    basis?: string // initial main size of the component\n    order?: number // order in flex container\n    align?: &quot;start&quot; | &quot;end&quot; | &quot;center&quot; | &quot;stretch&quot; // cross-axis alignment\n    justify?: &quot;start&quot; | &quot;end&quot; | &quot;center&quot; | &quot;between&quot; | &quot;around&quot; // main-axis alignment\n  }[]\n  direction?: &quot;row&quot; | &quot;row-reverse&quot; | &quot;column&quot; | &quot;column-reverse&quot;\n  wrap?: &quot;nowrap&quot; | &quot;wrap&quot; | &quot;wrap-reverse&quot;\n  gap?: string\n}\nExample Usage\nComponent.Flex({\n  components: [\n    {\n      Component: Component.Search(),\n      grow: true, // Search will grow to fill available space\n    },\n    { Component: Component.Darkmode() }, // Darkmode keeps its natural size\n  ],\n  direction: &quot;row&quot;,\n  gap: &quot;1rem&quot;,\n})\n\n\n                  \n                  Overriding behavior \n                  \n                \n\nComponents inside Flex get an additional CSS class flex-component that add the display: flex property. If you want to override this behavior, you can add a display property to the component’s CSS class in your custom CSS file.\n.flex-component {\n  display: block; // or any other display type\n}\n\n\nMobileOnly Component\nThe MobileOnly component is a wrapper that makes its child component only visible on mobile devices. This is useful for creating responsive layouts where certain components should only appear on smaller screens.\nExample Usage\nComponent.MobileOnly(Component.Spacer())\nDesktopOnly Component\nThe DesktopOnly component is the counterpart to MobileOnly. It makes its child component only visible on desktop devices. This helps create responsive layouts where certain components should only appear on larger screens.\nExample Usage\nComponent.DesktopOnly(Component.TableOfContents())\nConditionalRender Component\nThe ConditionalRender component is a wrapper that conditionally renders its child component based on a provided condition function. This is useful for creating dynamic layouts where components should only appear under certain conditions.\ntype ConditionalRenderConfig = {\n  component: QuartzComponent\n  condition: (props: QuartzComponentProps) =&gt; boolean\n}\nExample Usage\nComponent.ConditionalRender({\n  component: Component.Search(),\n  condition: (props) =&gt; props.displayClass !== &quot;fullpage&quot;,\n})\nThe example above would only render the Search component when the page is not in fullpage mode.\nComponent.ConditionalRender({\n  component: Component.Breadcrumbs(),\n  condition: (page) =&gt; page.fileData.slug !== &quot;index&quot;,\n})\nThe example above would hide breadcrumbs on the root index.md page."},"quartz/docs/layout":{"slug":"quartz/docs/layout","filePath":"quartz/docs/layout.md","title":"Layout","links":["quartz/docs/tags/component","quartz/docs/layout-components","quartz/docs/advanced/creating-components","quartz/docs/configuration"],"tags":[],"content":"Certain emitters may also output HTML files. To enable easy customization, these emitters allow you to fully rearrange the layout of the page.

This doesn’t appear visually on the page and is only is responsible for metadata about the document like the tab title, scripts, and styles.\nheader is a set of components that are laid out horizontally and appears before the beforeBody section. This enables you to replicate the old Quartz 3 header bar where the title, search bar, and dark mode toggle. By default, Quartz 4 doesn’t place any components in the header.\n\n\n\nQuartz components, like plugins, can take in additional properties as configuration options. If you’re familiar with React terminology, you can think of them as Higher-order Components.\nSee a list of all the components for all available components along with their configuration options. Additionally, Quartz provides several built-in higher-order components for layout composition - see layout-components for more details.\nYou can also checkout the guide on creating components if you’re interested in further customizing the behaviour of Quartz.\nLayout breakpoints\nQuartz has different layouts depending on the width the screen viewing the website.\nThe breakpoints for layouts can be configured in variables.scss.\n\nmobile: screen width below this size will use mobile layout.\ndesktop: screen width above this size will use desktop layout.\nScreen width between mobile and desktop width will use the tablet layout.\n\n$breakpoints: (\n  mobile: 800px,\n  desktop: 1200px,\n);\nStyle\nMost meaningful style changes like colour scheme and font can be done simply through the general configuration options. However, if you’d like to make more involved style changes, you can do this by writing your own styles. Quartz 4, like Quartz 3, uses Sass for styling.\nYou can see the base style sheet in quartz/styles/base.scss and write your own in quartz/styles/custom.scss.\n\n\n                  \n                  Note\n                  \n                \n\nSome components may provide their own styling as well! For example, quartz/components/Darkmode.tsx imports styles from quartz/components/styles/darkmode.scss. If you’d like to customize styling for a specific component, double check the component definition to see how its styles are defined.\n\n"},"quartz/docs/migrating-from-Quartz-3":{"slug":"quartz/docs/migrating-from-Quartz-3","filePath":"quartz/docs/migrating from Quartz 3.md","title":"Migrating from Quartz 3","links":["quartz/docs/configuration","quartz/docs/hosting","quartz/docs/features/folder-and-tag-listings","quartz/docs/advanced/creating-components"],"tags":[],"content":"As you already have Quartz locally, you don’t need to fork or clone it again.

Quartz 4 now uses a Node-based static-site generation process which should lead to a much more helpful error messages and an overall smoother user experience.\nFull-hot reload: The many rough edges of how hugo-obsidian integrated with Hugo meant that watch mode didn’t re-trigger hugo-obsidian to update the content index. This lead to a lot of weird cases where the watch mode output wasn’t accurate. Quartz 4 now uses a cohesive parse, filter, and emit pipeline which gets run on every change so hot-reloads are always accurate.\nReplacing Go template syntax with JSX: Quartz 3 used Go templates to create layouts for pages. However, the syntax isn’t great for doing any sort of complex rendering (like text processing) and it got very difficult to make any meaningful layout changes to Quartz 3. Quartz 4 uses an extension of JavaScript syntax called JSX which allows you to write layout code that looks like HTML in JavaScript which is significantly easier to understand and maintain.\nA new extensible configuration and plugin system: Quartz 3 was hard to configure without technical knowledge of how Hugo’s partials worked. Extensions were even hard to make. Quartz 4’s configuration and plugin system is designed to be extended by users while making updating to new versions of Quartz easy.\n\nThings to update\n\nYou will need to update your deploy scripts. See the hosting guide for more details.\nEnsure that your default branch on GitHub is updated from hugo to v4.\nFolder and tag listings have also changed.\n\nFolder descriptions should go under content/&lt;folder-name&gt;/index.md where &lt;folder-name&gt; is the name of the folder.\nTag descriptions should go under content/tags/&lt;tag-name&gt;.md where &lt;tag-name&gt; is the name of the tag.\n\n\nSome HTML layout may not be the same between Quartz 3 and Quartz 4. If you depended on a particular HTML hierarchy or class names, you may need to update your custom CSS to reflect these changes.\nIf you customized the layout of Quartz 3, you may need to translate these changes from Go templates back to JSX as Quartz 4 no longer uses Hugo. For components, check out the guide on creating components for more details on this.\n"},"quartz/docs/philosophy":{"slug":"quartz/docs/philosophy","filePath":"quartz/docs/philosophy.md","title":"Philosophy of Quartz","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"A garden should be a true hypertext\n\nThe garden is the web as topology. Every walk through the garden creates new paths, new meanings, and when we add things to the garden we add them in a way that allows many future, unpredicted relationships.\n(The Garden and the Stream)\n\nThe problem with the file cabinet is that it focuses on efficiency of access and interoperability rather than generativity and creativity. Thinking is not linear, nor is it hierarchical. In fact, not many things are linear or hierarchical at all. Then why is it that most tools and thinking strategies assume a nice chronological or hierarchical order for my thought processes?\nThe ideal tool for thought for me would embrace the messiness of my mind, and organically help insights emerge from chaos instead of forcing an artificial order. A rhizomatic, not arboresecent, form of note taking.\nMy goal with a digital garden is not purely as an organizing system and information store (though it works nicely for that). I want my digital garden to be a playground for new ways ideas can connect together. As a result, existing formal organizing systems like Zettelkasten or the hierarchical folder structures of Notion don’t work well for me. There is way too much upfront friction that by the time I’ve thought about how to organize my thought into folders categories, I’ve lost it.\nQuartz embraces the inherent rhizomatic and web-like nature of our thinking and tries to encourage note-taking in a similar form.\n\nA garden should be shared\nThe goal of digital gardening should be to tap into your network’s collective intelligence to create constructive feedback loops. If done well, I have a shareable representation of my thoughts that I can send out into the world and people can respond. Even for my most half-baked thoughts, this helps me create a feedback cycle to strengthen and fully flesh out that idea.\nQuartz is designed first and foremost as a tool for publishing digital gardens to the web. To me, digital gardening is not just passive knowledge collection. It’s a form of expression and sharing.\n\n“[One] who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but [they] also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important.”\n— Richard Hamming\n\nThe goal of Quartz is to make sharing your digital garden free and simple.\n\nA garden should be your own\nAt its core, Quartz is designed to be easy to use enough for non-technical people to get going but also powerful enough that senior developers can tweak it to work how they’d like it to work.\n\nIf you like the default configuration of Quartz and just want to change the content, the only thing that you need to change is the contents of the content folder.\nIf you’d like to make basic configuration tweaks but don’t want to edit source code, one can tweak the plugins and components in quartz.config.ts and quartz.layout.ts in a guided manner to their liking.\nIf you’d like to tweak the actual source code of the underlying plugins, components, or even build process, Quartz purposefully ships its full source code to the end user to allow customization at this level too.\n\nMost software either confines you to either\n\nMakes it easy to tweak content but not the presentation\nGives you too many knobs to tune the presentation without good opinionated defaults\n\nQuartz should feel powerful but ultimately be an intuitive tool fully within your control. It should be a piece of agentic software. Ultimately, it should have the right affordances to nudge users towards good defaults but never dictate what the ‘correct’ way of using it is."},"quartz/docs/plugins/AliasRedirects":{"slug":"quartz/docs/plugins/AliasRedirects","filePath":"quartz/docs/plugins/AliasRedirects.md","title":"AliasRedirects","links":["quartz/docs/configuration"],"tags":["plugin/emitter"],"content":"This plugin emits HTML redirect pages for aliases and permalinks defined in the frontmatter of content files.\nFor example, A foo.md has the following frontmatter\nfoo.md---\ntitle: &quot;Foo&quot;\nalias:\n  - &quot;bar&quot;\n---\nThe target host.me/bar will be redirected to host.me/foo\nNote that these are permanent redirect.\nThe emitter supports the following aliases:\n\naliases\nalias\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Note\n                  \n                \n\nFor information on how to add, remove or configure plugins, see the Configuration page.\n\n\nThis plugin has no configuration options.\nAPI\n\nCategory: Emitter\nFunction name: Plugin.AliasRedirects().\nSource: quartz/plugins/emitters/aliases.ts.\n"},"quartz/docs/plugins/Assets":{"slug":"quartz/docs/plugins/Assets","filePath":"quartz/docs/plugins/Assets.md","title":"Assets","links":["quartz/docs/configuration"],"tags":["plugin/emitter"],"content":"This plugin emits all non-Markdown static assets in your content folder (like images, videos, HTML, etc).

If you have a folder for all your images in quartz/static/my-images, an example for socialImage could be &quot;my-images/cover.png&quot;. Alternatively, you can use a fully qualified URL like &quot;example.com/cover.png&quot;.\n\n\n                  \n                  Info \n                  \n                \n\nThe priority for what image will be used for the cover image looks like the following: frontmatter property &gt; generated image (if enabled) &gt; default image.\nThe default image (quartz/static/og-image.png) will only be used as a fallback if nothing else is set. If the Custom OG Images emitter plugin is enabled, it will be treated as the new default per page, but can be overwritten by setting the socialImage frontmatter property for that page.\n\n\nCustomization\nYou can fully customize how the images being generated look by passing your own component to imageStructure. This component takes JSX + some page metadata/config options and converts it to an image using satori. Vercel provides an online playground that can be used to preview how your JSX looks like as a picture. This is ideal for prototyping your custom design.\nFonts\nYou will also be passed an array containing a header and a body font (where the first entry is header and the second is body). The fonts matches the ones selected in theme.typography.header and theme.typography.body from quartz.config.ts and will be passed in the format required by satori. To use them in CSS, use the .name property (e.g. fontFamily: fonts[1].name to use the “body” font family).\nAn example of a component using the header font could look like this:\nsocialImage.tsxexport const myImage: SocialImageOptions[&quot;imageStructure&quot;] = (...) =&gt; {\n  return &lt;p style={{ fontFamily: fonts[0].name }}&gt;Cool Header!&lt;/p&gt;\n}\n\n\n                  \n                  Local fonts \n                  \n                \n\nFor cases where you use a local fonts under static folder, make sure to set the correct @font-face in custom.scss\ncustom.scss@font-face {\n  font-family: &quot;Newsreader&quot;;\n  font-style: normal;\n  font-weight: normal;\n  font-display: swap;\n  src: url(&quot;/static/Newsreader.woff2&quot;) format(&quot;woff2&quot;);\n}\nThen in quartz/util/og.tsx, you can load the Satori fonts like so:\nquartz/util/og.tsximport { joinSegments, QUARTZ } from &quot;../path&quot;\nimport fs from &quot;fs&quot;\nimport path from &quot;path&quot;\n \nconst newsreaderFontPath = joinSegments(QUARTZ, &quot;static&quot;, &quot;Newsreader.woff2&quot;)\nexport async function getSatoriFonts(headerFont: FontSpecification, bodyFont: FontSpecification) {\n  // ... rest of implementation remains same\n  const fonts: SatoriOptions[&quot;fonts&quot;] = [\n    ...headerFontData.map((data, idx) =&gt;
