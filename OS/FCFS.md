### First come first serve


process id PID
burst time BT
arrival time AT

if arrival time is same, tiebreak is done by the shortest process id

**turn around time** = *PFT* - *PAT* 

pft = process finish time
pat = process arival time

**waiting time** = *turn around time* - *burst time*

**response time** = *process start time* - *process arrival time*

response time and waiting time will be same in non-premptive scheduling


**Throughout** : *number of process completed per unit of time*

so, 3 process completed in 30 units of time means throughput is 3/30

**CPU utilization** : *total burst time / completion time of all process*

(test question)
