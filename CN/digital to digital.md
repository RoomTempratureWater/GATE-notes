digital data --> digital signal

types of digital signals:
- unipolar:
	- all signal levels are on one side of time axis either above or below

- polar:
	- signal levels will be on both sides of time axis

Polar signal encoding techniques:
- NRZ (non-return to zero) (also in unipolar) [[NRZ]]
- RZ (return to zero)
- biphase
	- Manchester
	- Differential Manchester
