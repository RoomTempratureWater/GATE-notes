Channels are of 2 types:
- base band 
- broadband

Baseband:
- its like a railway track so only one signal can pass at a given time
- digital signal
- collision can occur
Broadband:
- its like a highway, can carry multiple signals at once
- analog signal
- no collision

types of encoding:
- [[digital to digital]] signal
- Digital to Analog
- Analog to Digital
- Analog to Analog

attenuation: loss of power during signal travel
