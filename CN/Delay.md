## Types of Network Delay in Physical Layer 
1. **Propagation Delay (T<sub>p</sub>)**: The time it takes for a signal to travel from the sender to the receiver over the medium. This delay depends on the distance between the two points and the speed at which the signal travels through the medium. 
2. **Transmission Delay (T<sub>t</sub>)**: The time required to push all the bits of the packet onto the medium. It depends on the packet size and the data transmission rate (bandwidth) of the medium. 
3. **Processing Delay**: The time it takes for network devices (such as switches, routers, or hubs) to process the packet headers and make forwarding decisions. 
4. **Queuing Delay**: The time a packet spends waiting in a queue before it can be transmitted. This delay can vary depending on network congestion and the device's handling capacity. 5. 
5. **Jitter**: The variation in the time it takes for packets to travel from the sender to the receiver. Jitter can be caused by changes in the queuing and processing delays.

### Formulae

- *(T<sub>t</sub>) = packet or data size / bandwidth*
- *(T<sub>p</sub>) = distance between hosts / speed of wave or signal*
