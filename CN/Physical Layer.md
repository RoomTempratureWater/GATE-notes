The physical layer is the first and lowest layer in the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model. It is responsible for the physical connection between devices, including the transmission and reception of raw bitstreams over a physical medium. This layer deals with the hardware aspects of networking, such as cables, switches, and other transmission mediums. Key functions of the physical layer include:

1. **Data Encoding and Signaling**: Converting data into signals suitable for the transmission medium.
2. **Transmission and Reception**: Sending and receiving raw bits across the network.
3. **Physical Medium**: Handling the physical connection methods, like electrical signals over copper wires, light signals over fiber optics, or radio signals in wireless communications.
4. **Topology and Layout**: Defining the physical structure of the network, such as star, ring, or bus topologies.
5. **Bit Rate Control**: Managing the rate of data transmission in bits per second.

Overall, the physical layer ensures that the raw data is transmitted over a physical medium, forming the foundation for higher layers to build upon.
