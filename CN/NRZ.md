## unipolar NRZ
1 --> positive level
0 --> negative level
![[Photos/Pasted image 20240708124847.png]]


Disadvantages:
- we want DC component to be 0 (whose net power is 0)
- sync of continous 0 or 1 is a problem

## polar NRZ

### NRZ - L

1 --> +ve level, 0 --> -ve level or vice versa

![[Photos/Pasted image 20240708125956.png]]

Disadvantages:
- DC component non zero
- sync of continous bits is not possible
### NRZ - I
- 1 -> change in leve
- 0 -> no change in level
