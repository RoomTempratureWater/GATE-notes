If XOR of 2 codewords is an valid codeword, then we can say the codewords are linear block codes
(code word is basically a data word and then added some parity/redundants bits to it)

| DW  | CDW |
| --- | --- |
| 00  | 000 |
| 01  | 011 |
| 10  | 101 |
| 11  | 110 |

since xor of 000 and 011 gives 011 
and XOR(011, 101) = 110
etc.

we can say these codewords are linear block codes

- [[2D parity check code]]
- [[Cyclic code]]
- [[Check sum]]
