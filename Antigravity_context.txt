This is a obsidian notes repository for GATE CSE 2027 preparation, my name is Jonathan.

whenever you are summarizing notes, make sure to include a short note and a long note .md file.

short notes will be in hinglish and they are meant to be used during quick revision later on in my preparation

long notes are for understanding.

each topic has folder and 2 subfolders - one for long notes and one for short notes.


use math formatting whenever required.
put diagrams whenever required.

update tracker.md file for every note added.

tracker.md will have

topic | subtopic | date | long note link | short note link | yt link |

in short and long notes you can add reference questions from the questions-filtered.json file.
you can use the .py (find_questions.py, filter_questions_refined.py for ex) files you created to get the questions from the json
note: try to use existing python files to fetch the questions instead of creating python scripts yourself

basic folders for topics are created (ex DM, TOC etc) when you create a short and long note, create it in topic/long and topic/short
and name it as {subtopic}_{any_identifier_name}.md

add diagrams to short and long notes wherever required and enrich the notes

everytime i ask you to do this, you should create a new LONG note, but SHORT note you need to use your discretion, if you think the content is different and needs a new note, then make a new note else append to the existing one related to the topic/subtopic

for tagging each note, use tags.txt file and ONLY use tags from there for each note.
add links to other notes as well, use tracker.md to find relevant notes to link to.

make sure to git pull latest changes and create a new branch before making any changes.
push branch to remote after changes.
